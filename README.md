A Fantasy Farming Adventure

I am Mark Wells, and spriteSeed is my first effort in game design and development. As of March 2018 I am working in Unity. I wanted to see a hybrid of farming and fantasy-adventure styles, inspired by the aesthetics and mechanics of Harvest Moon and the Legend of Zelda series. 

I was motivated by the exclusion I see in these genres. It disappoints me when games choose to include gender and relationships, then put strict limits on them. Despite what they say, it is deliberate of course; computers have no concept of gender roles or rules until programmed by humans, whose values are revealed in the design. Some have argued that games like Harvest Moon are an "innocent fantasy" with no place for diverse identities and relationships. I don't think it's innocent, though, to fantasize about a world without LGBTQ+ people, for example. It also concerns me when all characters in a "fantasy" are white.  I want to ask, "why do you fantasize about this?"

I'm not trying to make an LGBTQ+ game. I'm more interested in telling stories about animals, crops, and ghosts. spriteSeed is a fantasy about healing a broken world. But my fantasies don't subtract people from reality. I hope anyone can play my game and see themself at the centre where they belong.
