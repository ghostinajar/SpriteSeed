A Fantasy Farming Adventure

I am Mark Wells, and spriteSeed is my first effort in game design and development. As of March 2018 I am working in Unity. I wanted to see a hybrid of farming and fantasy-adventure styles, inspired by the aesthetics and mechanics of Harvest Moon and the Legend of Zelda series. 

I'm happy to see these genres becoming more inclusive, and I want this game to be a part of that. I'm disappointed when game designers choose to include gender and relationships, but put strict limits on them. Despite the excuses some designers have made for limiting these options, it is not costly to make gender and relationship flexible and diverse in games; computers have no concept of gender roles or rules until programmed by humans, whose values are revealed in the design. Some have argued that games like Harvest Moon are an "innocent fantasy" with no place for diverse identities and relationships. I don't think it's innocent, though, to fantasize about a world without LGBTQ+ people, for example. It also concerns me when all characters in a "fantasy" are white.  I want to ask, "why do you fantasize about this?"

I'm not trying to make an LGBTQ+ game. spriteSeed is a fantasy about healing a suffering world. I hope anyone can play my game and see themself at the centre where they belong.
